# Achiles Gomes dos Santos

ðŸ”­ I'm a Software Engineer from Brazil with over 10 years of experience designing and building robust software solutions.

Since 2018, I've been working on critical fintech products such as PIX, Boletos, TEDs, Open Finance platforms, and Internet Banking. My current tech stack includes Elixir (Phoenix), PostgreSQL, and Kafka, with a strong focus on backend development, distributed systems, and real-time processing.

I also have solid experience with PHP, Python, Golang, and cloud infrastructure using AWS (EC2, RDS, ECR, ECS, CloudWatch).

Iâ€™m passionate about clean architecture, performance, and diving deep into new technologies. I also enjoy sharing knowledge and collaborating with other developers to solve meaningful problems.
